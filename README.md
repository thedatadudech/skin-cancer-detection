# Skin Cancer Detection System

## Problem Description
This project implements a deep learning-based skin cancer detection system using dermoscopic images. Early detection of skin cancer is crucial for successful treatment, with melanoma being one of the most aggressive forms. This system assists healthcare professionals in preliminary screening by analyzing dermoscopic images and classifying them into different types of skin lesions.

### Clinical Relevance
- Assists in early detection of melanoma and other skin cancers
- Provides quick preliminary screening
- Helps prioritize cases for dermatologist review
- Supports decision-making in clinical settings

## Dataset
The project uses the HAM10000 dataset ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset.
